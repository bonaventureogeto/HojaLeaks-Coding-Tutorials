* Heap Sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a structure called a **heap**. A heap is a complete binary tree, which means each level of the tree is filled from left to right.
    
* There are two types of heaps: **max-heaps** and **min-heaps**. For Heap Sort, we use a **max-heap**.
    
* Each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes in a max-heap, and the largest element is always at the root.
