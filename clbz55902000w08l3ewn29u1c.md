Web Assembly (WASM) and Kubernetes are two technologies that have recently gained a lot of attention in the software development world. Both have the potential to significantly improve the performance and efficiency of software applications, but they are designed for different purposes. In this blog post, we will compare WASM and Kubernetes to help you understand how they differ and how they can be used together.

### **What is** [Web Assembly](https://hojaleaks.com/web-assembly-demystified)**?**

Web Assembly is a new programming language that runs in the browser. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and portable, making it a great choice for applications that need to run on multiple platforms. WASM is compiled from other programming languages like C, C++, and Rust, which means that developers can use the languages they are already familiar with to build WASM applications.

Here is an article I wrote about [Web Assembly](https://hojaleaks.com/web-assembly-demystified) Head over and check it out. It fully explains what WASM is and how it works.

### **What is Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system that is used to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. It is designed to be highly scalable and flexible, making it a great choice for applications that need to run on multiple servers. Kubernetes is a tool that helps developers automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### **How do Web Assembly and Kubernetes differ?**

The main difference between WASM and Kubernetes is the purpose they serve. WASM is a programming language that is designed to run in the browser, while Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that is used to deploy and manage applications.

Another key difference is the way they are used. WASM is used to build applications that run in the browser, while Kubernetes is used to deploy and manage applications that run on multiple servers.

### **How can Web Assembly and Kubernetes be used together?**

Although WASM and Kubernetes are designed for different purposes, they can be used together to build and deploy high-performance applications.

One way to use WASM and Kubernetes together is to build a WASM application and then use Kubernetes to deploy and scale the application on multiple servers. This allows developers to take advantage of the performance and portability of WASM while also leveraging the scalability and flexibility of Kubernetes.

Another way to use WASM and Kubernetes together is to build a WASM application that runs in a container. This allows developers to take advantage of the portability and security of containers while also leveraging the performance and efficiency of WASM.

## **Conclusion**

Web Assembly and Kubernetes are two powerful technologies that can be used together to build and deploy high-performance applications. While they serve different purposes, they can be combined to create applications that are fast, efficient, and scalable. If you are considering using WASM or Kubernetes in your next project, it is worth taking the time to understand how these technologies differ and how they can be used together to get the most out of your application.
